# Aero-15-Hackintosh
Hackintosh files for Gigabyte Aero15W.

i7-7700HQ
HD630 (GTX1060BAD)
16GB DDR4 2400 SODIMM
FHD 15'
Liteon SATA SSD

I will keep update this branch as long as I made progress.
A version of config for 10.12.6 is avaliable at /CLOVER/10.12.6/Downloads
Still working on 10.13.1. APFS is kinda tricky.
Good luck! (Both for me and for you)
